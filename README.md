Title: AI-Powered HR Recruitmrnt Portal: Complete AI powered Hiring
Challange Track 2

Description:
🤖 AI-Powered HR Recruitment Portal A modern end-to-end AI recruitment platform that automates candidate screening, interview scheduling, voice &amp; video screening, and final ranking, designed to help HR teams hire faster and smarter.


Problem Statement:
Traditional hiring processes are slow, biased, and inefficient. Recruiters spend countless hours , scheduling interviews, and evaluating candidates—often leading to missed talent, inconsistent decisions, and delayed hiring. There is a lack of an integrated system that can intelligently filter candidates, automate interview workflows, and objectively evaluate skills and behavior at scale.

Tech Stack & AI Tools:
This project is built using a modern full-stack architecture designed for scalability, security, and seamless AI-driven automation. The frontend is powered by React and TypeScript for an optimized and modular user experience, while Supabase handles backend operations, secure authentication, PostgreSQL database storage, and file storage for resumes, audio, and video recordings. AI capability is driven primarily through Google Gemini models for resume intelligence, audio analysis, and video-based behavioral scoring. The system integrates custom PDF parsing, real-time media capture APIs, and cloud deployment tools like Vercel — delivering a complete AI-assisted hiring pipeline.
